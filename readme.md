## Wordpress WPML - partial slug remover - Plugin

Trying to have Wordpress pages with language URLs â€“ and the Blog homepage without ?

When using WPML and "folder URL structure" you can modify partial pages to be called without language
information in their URL.

```
example.com/en/
example.com/en/blog
example.com/en/blog/example-post
example.com/en/blog/category/example-category
example.com/en/example-page
example.com/en/another-example-page

```

can be modified to

```
example.com/en/
example.com/blog
example.com/blog/example-post
example.com/blog/category/example-category
example.com/example-page
example.com/en/another-example-page
```

Heads up! This plugin supports only the "language folder" option of WPML.

Activate the Plugin and manage the behavior with "WPML->Translation options"

![wpml_admin](wpml_admin.png)

"not translatable" - every active language get removed from the url for this post type or taxonomy.

"translatable" - an option "disable language in URL" appears for this post type within the wpml post box.
Check this checkbox to remove the language folder for this item only.  
![wpml_optional](wpml_languagepicker.png)

if you set an item to "not translatable" the option "disable language in URL" 
is not visible because the language folder get removed anyway in any case.

### how to remove language folder from "/blog"
1. set posts to "not translatable" 
2. create a "blog" page
3. check "disable language in URL" for blog page
4. setup "blog page" within "settings->read"
5. set permalink structure to "/%category%/%postname%/"
6. update permalinks
